### Laravel calibre library
This is a custom implementation of Calibre Web to make it Kindle friendly.
Kindle devices have a simple web browser that cannot handle complex JavaScript.

### Instalation
You'll need to either move your calibre library to "/storage/app/public/calibre_library", or create a symbolic link.
